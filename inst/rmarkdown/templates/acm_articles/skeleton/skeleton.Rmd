# Introduction{-}
Using a tool like [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) to write scientific papers makes our work more transparent and reproducible. It also reduces the risk of errors, because we can dynamically insert tables, figures, and summary statistics directly from the data they are generated from, rather than transferring results manually from statistical software to manuscript.

This example illustrates how to use the latest ACM \LaTeX\ templates (Version 1.55, from September 11, 2018) in tandem with R Markdown to write papers for the CHI conference, in the CHI proceedings format. In this example, I mostly follow the content in the sample-sigchi.tex example from the ACM template, illustrating how to create this content through the R Markdown workflow.

# Paper meta data
We set meta data of the paper (copyright, authors, keywords, title, keywords, optional teaser figure) in the YAML header of the .Rmd file. This is in the form of simple `key: value` pairs, for example `title: Writing CHI Proceedings Papers With R Markdown`. When compiling to a PDF, the information in the YAML header is plugged into the LaTeX template (which is itself specified in the YAML header with `template: sample-sigchi.tex`), for example `\title{$title$}`.

Note the sole **exception**: The CCS Concepts would be rather messy to insert from the YAML header, so I suggest you insert this directly into the sample-sigchi.tex template.

# The Body of The Paper
Typically, the body of a paper is organized into a hierarchical structure, with numbered or unnumbered headings for sections, subsections, sub-subsections, and even smaller sections.  Whereas in \LaTeX\ you'd use the command `\section` for main sections, in R Markdown you simply use `#`, as in `# The Body of The Paper`. For subsections, or sub-subsections, use more hashes, as in `## This Become a Subsection`, and `#### This Becomes a Paragraph Heading`.^[By the way, this is how to insert footnotes.] 

The compilation to PDF still is done via \LaTeX\, which handles their numbering and placement. If you want some section to be unnumbered in the output, add `{-}` after the section name, as in `# Unnumbered Section{-}`.

Indicate the start of a new paragraph with a blank line in your input file; that is why this sentence forms a separate paragraph.
This line, however, does not form a separate paragraph.

## Type Changes and *Special* Characters

Make words or phrases *italicized* by surrounding them with a single \*; **embolden** them by surrounding them with \*\***two**\*\*. `Typewriter-style` (for instance, for computer code) you create by  surrounding text with `` `backticks` ``.^[Another footnote here. Let's make this a rather long one to see how it looks.]

## Math Equations
You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles: inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of the three are discussed in the next sections. You can use usual \LaTeX\ syntax directly, 

### Inline (In-text) Equations
A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or in-text formula.  It is produced by the
**math** environment, which can be invoked by surrounding text with dollar signs: \$. You can use any of the symbols and structures, from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in \LaTeX\. For example, here's a nice equation inline: $\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0$. If you're writing in RStudio, you can even hover over it to see the rendered output displayed!

### Display Equations
A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the text and centered horizontally---is produced by using \LaTeX\ syntax directly to put the content in an `equation` environment. So here's that nice equation from above:
\begin{equation}
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{equation}.

In fact, you can use any arbitrary \LaTeX\ syntax directly in your .Rmd document.

To make an unnumbered display equation, just surround the expression with two dollar signs:
$$
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
$$

## Citations
Citations to articles [@bowman:reasoning; @braams:babel; @Cohen07], conference proceedings [@clark:pct] or maybe
books [@Lamport:LaTeX; @salas:calculus] listed
in the Bibliography section of your
article will occur throughout the text of your article.
You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this bibliography;
you simply need to insert one of several citation commands with
a key of the item cited in the proper location in
the \texttt{.tex} file~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.
The key is a short reference you invent to uniquely
identify each work; in this sample document, the key is
the first author's surname and a
word from the title.  This identifying key is included
with each item in the \texttt{.bib} file for your article.

The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file
are beyond the scope of this sample document, but more
information can be found in the \textit{Author's Guide},
and exhaustive details in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's
Guide} by Lamport~\shortcite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

This article shows only the plainest form
of the citation command, using \texttt{{\char'134}cite}.

Some examples.  A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an enumerated
journal article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire issue \cite{JCohen96},
a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
\cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation \cite{Editor00}
followed by the same example, however we only output the series if the volume number is given
\cite{Editor00a} (so Editor00a's series should NOT be present since it has no vol. no.),
a chapter in a divisible book \cite{Spector90}, a chapter in a divisible book
in a series \cite{Douglass98}, a multi-volume work as book \cite{Knuth97},
an article in a proceedings (of a conference, symposium, workshop for example)
(paginated proceedings article) \cite{Andler79}, a proceedings article
with all possible elements \cite{Smith10}, an example of an enumerated
proceedings article \cite{VanGundy07},
an informally published work \cite{Harel78}, a doctoral dissertation \cite{Clarkson85},
a master's thesis: \cite{anisi03}, an online document / world wide web
resource \cite{Thornburg01, Ablamowicz07, Poker06}, a video game (Case 1) \cite{Obama08} and (Case 2) \cite{Novak03}
and \cite{Lee05} and (Case 3) a patent \cite{JoeScientist001},
work accepted for publication \cite{rous08}, 'YYYYb'-test for prolific author
\cite{SaeediMEJ10} and \cite{SaeediJETC10}. Other cites might contain
'duplicate' DOI and URLs (some SIAM articles) \cite{Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}.
Boris / Barbara Beeton: multi-volume works as books
\cite{MR781536} and \cite{MR781537}.

A couple of citations with DOIs: \cite{2004:ITE:1009386.1010128,

\subsection{Tables}
Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best
placement for them is typically the top of the page
nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go
in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to
be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired
horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions
on \textbf{tabular} material
are found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed
output of this document.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
  \label{tab:freq}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
    \midrule
    \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\
    $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
    \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
    $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
live area, use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's
contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this
wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more desirable.
Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
in the printed output of this document.


\begin{table*}
  \caption{Some Typical Commands}
  \label{tab:commands}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Command &A Number & Comments\\
    \midrule
    \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table*}
% end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!

It is strongly recommended to use the package booktabs~\cite{Fear05}
and follow its main principles of typography with respect to tables:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Never, ever use vertical rules.
\item Never use double rules.
\end{enumerate}
It is also a good idea not to overuse horizontal rules.


\subsection{Figures}

Like tables, figures cannot be split across pages; the best placement
for them is typically the top or the bottom of the page nearest their
initial cite.  To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of
figures, use the environment \textbf{figure} to enclose the figure and
its caption.

This sample document contains examples of \texttt{.eps} files to be
displayable with \LaTeX.  If you work with pdf\LaTeX, use files in the
\texttt{.pdf} format.  Note that most modern \TeX\ systems will convert
\texttt{.eps} to \texttt{.pdf} for you on the fly.  More details on
each of these are found in the \textit{Author's Guide}.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{fly}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[height=1in, width=1in]{fly}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic
that has been resized with the \texttt{includegraphics} command.}
\end{figure}


As was the case with tables, you may want a figure that spans two
columns.  To do this, and still to ensure proper ``floating''
placement of tables, use the environment \textbf{figure*} to enclose
the figure and its caption.  And don't forget to end the environment
with \textbf{figure*}, not \textbf{figure}!

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics{flies}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic
that needs to span two columns of text.}
\end{figure*}


\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[height=1in, width=1in]{rosette}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic that has
been resized with the \texttt{includegraphics} command.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Theorem-like Constructs}

Other common constructs that may occur in your article are the forms
for logical constructs like theorems, axioms, corollaries and proofs.
ACM uses two types of these constructs:  theorem-like and
definition-like.

Here is a theorem:
\begin{theorem}
  Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.  If $G$ is
  an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$, then
  \begin{displaymath}
    \int^b_af(t)\,dt = G(b) - G(a).
  \end{displaymath}
\end{theorem}

Here is a definition:
\begin{definition}
  If $z$ is irrational, then by $e^z$ we mean the
  unique number that has
  logarithm $z$:
  \begin{displaymath}
    \log e^z = z.
  \end{displaymath}
\end{definition}

The pre-defined theorem-like constructs are \textbf{theorem},
\textbf{conjecture}, \textbf{proposition}, \textbf{lemma} and
\textbf{corollary}.  The pre-defined de\-fi\-ni\-ti\-on-like constructs are
\textbf{example} and \textbf{definition}.  You can add your own
constructs using the \textsl{amsthm} interface~\cite{Amsthm15}.  The
styles used in the \verb|\theoremstyle| command are \textbf{acmplain}
and \textbf{acmdefinition}.

Another construct is \textbf{proof}, for example,

\begin{proof}
  Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number $L$ such that
  \begin{displaymath}
    \lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.
  \end{displaymath}
  Then
  \begin{displaymath}
    l=\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)
    = \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
    \left[ g{x} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right ]
    = \lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x) \cdot \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
    \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0\cdot L = 0,
  \end{displaymath}
  which contradicts our assumption that $l\neq 0$.
\end{proof}

\section{Conclusions}
This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
Appendices; brief samples of these
follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
this paper are to articles which have nothing to
do with the present subject and are used as
examples only.
%\end{document}  % This is where a 'short' article might terminate



\appendix
%Appendix A
\section{Headings in Appendices}
The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for
the body of the article are different in the appendices.
In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
\textbf{section} is used to
indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
designation (i.e., the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
hierarchical structure
\textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this
document in Appendix-appropriate form:
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsection{The Body of the Paper}
\subsubsection{Type Changes and  Special Characters}
\subsubsection{Math Equations}
\paragraph{Inline (In-text) Equations}
\paragraph{Display Equations}
\subsubsection{Citations}
\subsubsection{Tables}
\subsubsection{Figures}
\subsubsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
\subsubsection*{A Caveat for the \TeX\ Expert}
\subsection{Conclusions}
\subsection{References}
Generated by bibtex from your \texttt{.bib} file.  Run latex,
then bibtex, then latex twice (to resolve references)
to create the \texttt{.bbl} file.  Insert that \texttt{.bbl}
file into the \texttt{.tex} source file and comment out
the command \texttt{{\char'134}thebibliography}.
% This next section command marks the start of
% Appendix B, and does not continue the present hierarchy
